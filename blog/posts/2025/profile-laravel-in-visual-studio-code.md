# Profile Laravel in Visual Studio Code

![Cover Image](imgs/laravel-performance_0.png)

Performance always matters. Your Laravel application might be beautifully designed and written, but there's always the possibility of hidden bottlenecks. Is it unnecessarily slow? Can it be optimized further? Sometimes, a single function can consume most of your CPU time. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to profile your **Laravel** application in **Visual Studio Code** to uncover and address these issues.

## What is Profiling?

Simply put, profiling tracks all function calls in your application, recording their start and end times. This information allows you to:

- Identify which functions consume the most time.
- See how many times a specific function is called.
- Understand the call tree of all functions across the entire application.

With this data, you can pinpoint performance bottlenecks and optimize your application effectively.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **PHP** installed.
- The PHP [`Xdebug`](https://xdebug.org/docs/install) extension installed.
- The PHP `zlib` extension enabled (recommended).
- The [PHP Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code.
- The [PHP Profiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.profiler-php-vscode) extension (installed automatically with PHP Tools).

![VS Code Extensions](imgs/extensions.png)

To confirm PHP and Xdebug are correctly configured, open any PHP file in Visual Studio Code and check the _OUTPUT_ panel for a confirmation message:

## Setting Up Your Laravel Workspace

1. **Open Laravel Application**

   Open folder with the Laravel application. You should see the directory structure like this:

   ![Laravel Workspace in VS Code](imgs/laravel-workspace.png)

2. **Create a `launch.json` Profile**

   If you donâ€™t already have a `launch.json` file, follow these steps:
	 
   - Open the `Run and Debug` panel.
   - Click on `create a launch.json file` and choose the `PHP (Xdebug)` option.

3. **Add the Profiling Configuration**

   Ensure your `launch.json` file includes the following profile:

   ```json
	 "configurations": [
   {
       "name": "Launch built-in server and Profile",
       "type": "php",
       "request": "launch",
       "noDebug": true,
       "runtimeArgs": [
           "-S",
           "localhost:8000",
           "-t",
           ".",
           "../vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Foundation/resources/server.php"
       ],
       "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/public",
       "serverReadyAction": {
           "action": "openExternally"
       },
       "envFile": "../.env",
       "profile": true,
       "openProfile": true
   }
	 ]
   ```

## Running the Profiler

1. **Select the Profiling Configuration**

   In the `Run and Debug` panel, choose the **"Launch built-in server and Profile"** option:

   ![Choose PHP profiling profile](imgs/debug-choose-profiling.png)

2. **Start Debugging**

  Press **F5** to start the profiling session. This will:
  - Launch the built-in PHP server.
  - Open your Laravel application in a browser.
	
  You should see a smilar output in VS Code's `DEBUG CONSOLE`:
	
  ![debug console](imgs/debug-console.png)

3. **Make Web Requests**

Navigate through the pages you wish to profile. Each request generates a separate profiling file, which will open automatically when the profiling ends.

4. **Stop the Profiling Session**

   Return to Visual Studio Code and click the **Stop** button to end the session. Note, it may take a few seconds.

5. **View Profiling Results**

   The profiling output will appear in new document tabs:

## Analyzing Profiling Data

![Inspecting Laravel Profiling](imgs/inspect-laravel-profiling.gif)

Each profiling file corresponds to a single request. Here's how to interpret the results:

**Aggregated Time**

   Sort by _Time (ms)_ to identify the "heaviest" functions.

**Call Counts**

   Sort by _Calls_ to find the most frequently called functions.

**Highlight Hot Paths**

   Use the **Highlight in Source Code** option to visualize performance hotspots directly in your code:
