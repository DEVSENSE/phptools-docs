## Step 1 - Install VS Code for macOS.

Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor that works for Windows, Linux and macOS 10.9 or higher. You can download it directly from its [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you need a detailed setup guide, click [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).

 - When the download is complete, open VS Code.

 - On the `View` menu, select `Command Palette` (<kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>) and write the command 

 ```
 Extensions: Install from VSIX
 ```

 in the quick search box.

 - When the Open File Dialog opens, select the file with the `.vsix` extension which you downloaded. 

 Note: Activation of the product requires Internet connection.

 For more detailed information, you can refer to [managing extensions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

## Step 3 - Activation

After the successful installation, you should be prompted to [activate](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/configuration) your copy of PHP Tools. A pop-up window will show during the extension startup. Activation requires internet connection.

![phptools-vscode-activation](imgs\phptools-vscode-activation.png)

You will have to choose among 3 options:

 - "I have the license key" allows you enter the license key section and activate the extension.
 - "Get trial" sends you an e-mail with 14-day license key.

 - "More information" will open [this web page](https://www.devsense.com/en/purchase) with purchase options and license information.

 Once you have the license key and close the pop-up window above, you can activate your copy of the extension using the `VSCode's View - Command Palette` (<kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>), command `PHP Tools: Activate extension`. Enter your license key and confirm pressing `Enter`.

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

## Debugging

For debugging purposes, PHP has `Xdebug`. You can read about `Xdebug` features [here](https://xdebug.org/docs/).

![vscode-xdebug](imgs\vscode-xdebug.png)

For macOS users, you can install the `Xdebug` extension for your version of PHP using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). They recommend using [PECL](https://xdebug.org/docs/install) to install it. Another option is to compile the [source code](https://github.com/xdebug/xdebug) and then install.

PEAR/PECL is PHP's Package Repository for easy download and installation of `Xdebug` and also other tools. You can download `PEAR` from its [Github page](https://github.com/pear/pearweb_phars/). Installing `PEAR/PECL` is as easy as writing the following on the terminal:

```
pecl install xdebug
```

You still need to add the correct line to your php.ini (change the path and filename to the correct one, and make sure you’re using the full path): 

```
zend_extension="/usr/local/php/modules/xdebug.so"
```

Now you are ready to start your first project! [Getting Started with PHP Tools: First PHP Project](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode).
