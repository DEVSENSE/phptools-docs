It's a neat plugin for IntelliJ (and PHPStorm) with machine learned code suggestions, working fully locally, providing suggestions instantly, not requiring Internet connection!

## Installing EAP

In order to install the plugin from **Early Access Program**, follow the steps on [plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/custom-release-channels.html](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/custom-release-channels.html#configure-a-custom-channel)

- Go to **Setting** / **Plugins**, and add **Custom Plugin Repository**:
  ```

	```

- Install

## How it Works

As you type, IntelliPHP generates a most probable line completion and offers it as an in-line suggestion. Confirm it with `TAB` key, and the suggestion gets inserted. The plugin does it all locally, within milliseconds, on your machine, without any Internet data transfer.
