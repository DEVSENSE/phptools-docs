In this tutorial I'm going to demonstrate how to setup remote debugging in PHP Tools for Visual Studio. The remote system in this example is running on **Ubuntu**, but it can be any Linux or Windows system.

## Configure remote system (Ubuntu)

This is actually the hardest part, but if you have your remote system configured properly you can skip this one.

### Install Apache and PHP

1. First you will need to install a web server and **PHP**. I'm going to install **Apache**, but feel free to install the web server of your preference.
 
 ```bash
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install apache2
 sudo apt-get install php
 sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php7.0
 ```
 
2. Get **Xdebug**

 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install php-xdebug
 ```
 
3. Turn **Xdebug** on. Open `php.ini`. I will use **nano** to edit text files in this tutorial, but feel free to use editor of your choice.
 
 ```bash
 sudo nano /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini
 ```
 
 Append these lines to the end of the file:
 
 ```
 [Xdebug]
 zend_extension=xdebug.so
 xdebug.remote_enable=1
 xdebug.remote_host=192.168.100.9
 xdebug.remote_port=9000
 ```

 You will need to alter `remote_host` option in this snippet. Change it to the IP address of the machine with Visual Studio. In my case IP address was `192.168.100.9`.

4. For the sample project from this tutorial you are going to need these PHP extensions.

 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install php-xml
 sudo apt-get install php-mbstring
 ```

### Create a site on Apache

1. Create directory

 ```bash
 sudo mkdir /var/www/example.org
 ```

2. Create a site on **Apache**.

 ```bash
 sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.org.conf
 sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.org.conf
 ```

3. The newly created file will look something like this (I've removed the comments so it's shorter):

 ```xml
 <VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
  DocumentRoot /var/www/html
  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
 </VirtualHost>
 ```

4. For this example I've chosen the site name `example.org`, so change the configuration file to:
 
 ```xml
 <VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin admin@example.org
  ServerName example.org
  ServerAlias www.example.org
  DocumentRoot /var/www/example.org
  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
 </VirtualHost>
 ```

5. Enable site

 ```bash
sudo a2ensite example.org
 ```

6. Restart **Apache**
 
 ```bash
 sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
 ```

### Install FTP server

Now you have a site, but you will also need a way to get the your php from development machine to the server. One option is to setup FTP server. I'm going to install **Vsftpd**; an FTP daemon available in **Ubuntu**. It is easy to install, set up, and maintain. 

1. Run the following command:
 
 ```bash
sudo apt install vsftpd
 ```

2. Start and enable the service with the commands:

 ```bash
sudo systemctl start vsftpd
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
 ```

#### Create FTP user

Create a user for the FTP service. This could be considered an account for generic FTP usage. You can always create more, and anyone with a user account on the server can log via FTP. 

1. The user will be called `ftpuser` and is created with the command:

 ```bash
sudo useradd -m ftpuser
```

2. Set the user's password with the command:

 ```bash
sudo passwd ftpuser
```

3. Setup previously created directory as home directory for `ftpuser`

 ```bash
sudo usermod -d /var/var/www/example.org ftpuser
```

4. Add permissions

 ```bash
sudo chown ftpuser /var/www/example.org
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.org
```

#### Configure VSFTP

1. Create a brand new configuration file. Before you do that, let's save the original with the command:

 ```bash
sudo mv /etc/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd.conf.orig
```

2. Create the new file with the command:

 ```bash
sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf
```

3. Place the following to the `vsftpd.conf`:

 ```
listen=NO
listen_ipv6=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
local_umask=022
dirmessage_enable=YES
use_localtime=YES
xferlog_enable=YES
connect_from_port_20=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
pam_service_name=vsftpd
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
ssl_enable=NO
pasv_enable=Yes
pasv_min_port=10000
pasv_max_port=10100
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
```

4. Restart the FTP server

 ```bash
sudo service vsftpd restart
```

## Configure development system

Now, when the remote system is fully configured you can setup a development environment, which should be considerably less work.

To be able to access `example.org` from your developement machine you have to modify the hosts file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Append the following line to the end of a file (modify IP adress to match your remote system).

 ```bash
 192.168.100.17 example.org
 ```

### Create a PHP project

1. If you happen to have **PHP Tools for Visual Studio** version `1.27 or higher` you can use the **New project** dialog.

 Just click `File | New | Project`, type **php** to the search bar and select **PHP Web Project**. 

 ![New Project - First Dialog](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/newproject.png)

2. Fill the location and the name.

 ![New Project - Second Dialog](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/newproject2.png)

3. Select **Simple CMS Project**, just to try out something a little more complex than the "Hello World" script.

 ![Create PHP Web Project ](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/newproject3.png)

4. If you don't have any **PHP** installation on **Windows**, **PHP Tools** will ask you if you'd like to install it, you can just click **Yes**.

 Then, you will get asked if you want to download composer packages. Click **Yes**.

### Configuring project
 
1. In **Visual Studio** your PHP Web Project has to be instructed about the web server setting in **Ubuntu**. Just right click on project node in the **Solution Explorer**, click **Properties**.

 ![Project Properties](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/properties.png)

2. For debugging to work properly on remote machine **PHP Tools for Visual Studio** need to know how to map paths from and to remote system. In this case path mapping is simple, so we can keep automatic path mapping and let **PHP Tools** to figure it out. But keep in mind when you will work with more complex projects path mapping will have to be explicitly defined, otherwise debugging will not work properly.

### Deployment

Since FTP server is already configured on remote system, you just need to configure publishing in Visual Studio.

1. While you are in project properties, Server tab, click on **Manage** in **Automatic Publish** section. And name a new profile.

 ![Profile Name](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/newprofile.png)

2. Then fill in FTP server address and user credentials. Use `ftpuser` created earlier in the tutorial

  ![Publish Profile](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/publish.png)
 
3. Click **Validate Connection** to check if you are able to connect to the remote server.

4. Close the dialog and now you can select publish trigger when publish will occur. I've selected **Before run**, but feel free to select other option.

### Debug

Now you should be able to debug remote PHP application in your Visual Studio. Just put a breakpoint to the location of your interest and press <kbd>F5</kbd>. 

 ![Breakpoint](https://blog.devsense.com/bl-content/uploads/pages/575cf0bbb61a09eafee5e5aee8838f7f/breakpoint.png)

When you check **Locals** pane you can see that you are really debugging **Ubuntu** system.
