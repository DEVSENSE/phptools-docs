## Overview of PHP Tools benefits


PHP Tools is an extension for Visual Studio and for VS Code IDEs designed for experienced developers looking to build professional platforms and any type of PHP application. The solution is based on [productivity, fast implementation, and easiness of use](https://blog.devsense.com/2019/03/factors-to-consider-when-choosing-your-php-development-tool).


PHP Tools is built on C# which is a huge advantage to PHP developers. C# allows the application to perform visibly faster than other similar solutions. Developers can easily enforce their specific coding styles, rules, and PSR standards for each project.


A noteworthy feature is IntelliSense, which provides smart, context-aware code completion, detailed tool tips and function parameter assistance. Also, it contains a complete PHP manual, learns from your code and performs type analysis. It's useful to minimize the amount of key strokes you have to do.

Another exceptional feature is the seamless refactoring functionality. You will avoid typos and keep your code clean by using it. You can easily refactor your entire PHP namespace with a few clicks. Refactoring can rename identifiers in place or with a detailed preview where you can uncheck single occurrences.


PHP Tools integrates with Xdebug and works great with all kinds of web servers, allowing you to debug your program quickly and intuitively. The app is a reliable, fast and smart coding assistant that includes [all the features you need]( https://www.devsense.com/en/features), and more in the best-in-class IDE.
