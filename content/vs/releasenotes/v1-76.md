# November 2023 (version 1.76)

Welcome to the November 2023 release of PHP Tools for Visual Studio!

## Improvements

- **Structured `object` Type**: dynamic objects can be annotated within doc comment using `object{property:type,}` syntax.
- **Global `@type` Aliases**: type aliases can be defined in the scope of entire file using doc comment `@type`, `@phpstan-type`, `@phpstan-import-type`, `@psalm-type`, `@psalm-import-type`. Previously, it only worked above classes and functions. Now it is also valid in a doc comment `/** */` at anywhere in global file scope.
- New **PHP 8.3** syntax is supported by the formatter.
- `list{}` doc comment shape.
- Navigation and completion in `@see` tag when in a namespace.
- `array_multisort()` does not treat the first argument as strictly passed by reference ([#1729](https://community.devsense.com/d/1729)).
- go to and code completion of file paths improvements ([#1735](https://community.devsense.com/d/1735)).
