# May 2025 (Version 1.85)

We‚Äôre excited to announce version 1.85 of PHP Tools, bringing a series of performance improvements, smarter type inference, enhanced Laravel support, and important bug fixes. This update continues our mission to provide accurate, efficient, and developer-friendly PHP tooling.

---

## üîß Improvements

### Smarter Type Handling and Inference

* **First-Class Callable Syntax**: Added proper type handling for the new first-class callable syntax introduced in PHP 8.1. This resolves type inference issues with callable references ([#2239](https://community.devsense.com/d/2239-incorrect-type-inference-for-first-class-callable-syntax-in-php-8-1)).
* **Instanceof Inference**: Improved type inference when using the `instanceof` operator, making conditions and smart casts more reliable.
* **Dynamic Properties**: Enhanced support for type inferring dynamic fields when the `__get()` magic method is defined.
* **Control Flow Analysis**: Several updates were made to improve the accuracy of control flow analysis, leading to better detection of unreachable code, type narrowing, and possible errors.
* **`explode()` Return Type**: Corrected type inference for the `explode()` function to avoid incorrectly including `bool` as a possible return type in PHP 8 and later.

### Enhanced Code Actions

* **Convert to Arrow Function**: Introduced a new code action that lets you quickly convert closures to arrow functions (`fn`) when applicable.
* **Improved `is_null()` Refactoring**: Refined the code action that replaces `is_null()` with strict comparison, especially in cases involving negation or complex expressions.

### Documentation and Annotation Support

* **PHPDoc Enhancements**:

  * Added support for the `@param-closure-this` tag, improving context awareness for closures.
  * Added validation and support for the `@require-implements` and `@require-extends` tags, ensuring annotated constraints are respected in inheritance.

* **Integrated Stubs Update**: Updated bundled PHP stubs to improve IntelliSense and type resolution for core functions and classes.
* **Lambda Scope Handling**: Adjusted handling of the `newScope` context in lambda functions, improving member visibility checks and code completion in closures and anonymous functions.

### Performance

* General performance improvements were implemented, resulting in a smoother development experience, especially in large codebases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Laravel-Specific Enhancements

We continue to deepen Laravel support to make development with the framework even more seamless:

* **Improved Type Inference**: Enhanced understanding of Laravel-specific helper functions and dynamic return types.
* **IDE Helper Compatibility**: Better compatibility with the `_ide_helper.php` file, including workarounds for improperly generated Eloquent classes.
* **Eloquent Integration**: Smarter autocompletion and type inference when using Eloquent models, especially when working with `Auth::user()` and `Request::user`.
* **IDE-Helper Hack Support**: Ensures Laravel code completion remains functional even when relying on the common IDE-helper hack.

## üêû Fixes

* **Stability Improvements**: Various under-the-hood fixes to enhance overall editor and language server stability.
* **Code Formatter Fixes**: Resolved several formatting inconsistencies for a cleaner and more predictable code style.
* **Closure Return Reference Fix**: Fixed an issue where returning a reference from a closure could lead to false-positive warnings ([#831](https://github.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/issues/831)).
