# March 2025 (version 1.84)

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the release of version 1.84, bringing powerful enhancements and seamless improvements to PHP in Visual Studio! This update improves full support for PHP 8.4, smarter type inference, refined formatting, and a significant boost to Laravel and Eloquent features. With optimized IntelliSense and crucial stability fixes, coding gets faster, smoother, and more intuitive. ðŸš€

## Laravel & Eloquent Support

### Laravel

- Code completion for the Eloquent "magic", and Laravel-specific functions.
- Extensible code completion through the special `ide.json` file.
- Type resolution for Laravel service containers (`app()`, `App::make()`).
- Completion for config keys in `config(..)`, `config()->string(..)`, `Config::get(..)`, and others.
- Completion of environment variables.
- Completion of view attributes in special Laravel functions.
- Completion of named routes in specific functions.
- Completion of route parameter names in specific functions.
- Completion of IDs from language translation files in specific functions.

### Eloquent

- Completing model columns in various Eloquent Query Builder methods. Columns are resolved from (what's defined first):
  - model class PHPDoc `@property`(s).
  - models Factory class `definition()` function.
  - using models table (if can be resolved), lookups migrations in `database/migrations/` and `Schema` definitions.
- Completing model dynamic fields.
- Completing magic `whereCOLUMN()` functions.
- Auto-completion for **query builder methods**, **model columns**, and **factory attributes**.
- Improved return type inference for `Model::query()`, `select()`, and `find(int)`.
- Enhanced support for **Eloquent local scopes**, `magic whereCOLUMN()` methods, and `@mixin<Builder>`.

## Code Analysis & Type Inference

- Improved handling of `static` return types in traits.
- Enhanced support for **@mixin**, **template-type<>**, and **iterable** type hints.
- Fixed PHPDoc annotation parsing and improved **@var** handling inside conditional blocks.
- Improved type inference for `int` and `float`, resolving issues with mixed types.
- Respected `@param` and `@var` annotations when inferring types.
- Better array unpacking type inferring.
- Better `foreach` control variable type inferring for old `Collection`.
- Respects `@var` annotation above `if` statement.
- Better `array_find()` return type inferring.
- Implemented support for callable type conversion.
- Fixed implicit visibility checks, ensuring proper **protected** access handling.
- Support for line comments in PHPDoc structured type names.

## Code Navigation & IntelliSense

- Fixing support for attributes above anonymous classes (formatting and language features).
- Fixed **hover and go-to-definition** issues for `class NAME` and `?FQN` syntax.
- Improved **inlay hints** for methods defined via `@mixin`, `new static()`, and closures.
- Corrected **mouse hover issues** and improved IntelliSense for PHP 8.4.
- Resolved tooltip rendering issues in traits and anonymous classes.

## PHP Project & Composer Improvements

- Fixed incorrect **composer package paths** in indexing.
- Improved handling of **PHAR files** in the project structure.
- Avoided parsing non-PHP entries in PHAR archives to optimize performance.
- Resolved **memory leak issues** related to PHP framework instances.

## Configuration & Code Formatting

- Added support for:
  - **Blank lines around properties, fields, and enums**.
  - **Property hooks in property promotion**.
  - **Asymmetric visibility formatting**.
  - **PER defining blank lines and JavaScript backtick processor**.
- Improved **blank line handling** for anonymous classes.

## Bug Fixes & Optimizations

- Stability fixes.
- Addressed **performance optimizations**, reducing unnecessary memory allocations.
- Fixed indirect returns of `static` from traits.
- Corrected **array unpacking behavior**.
