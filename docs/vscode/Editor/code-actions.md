## Code Actions

The editor is provided with so-called **Code Actions** - Quick Fixes and refactorings for the text currently under the caret. The available code action is annotated with a light bulb next to the text.

Available code actions are listed by clicking on the light bulb or pressing an associated keyboard shortcut (by default) <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd>.

Certain errors have also `Quick Fix` available. This provides the same list of code actions that should resolve the issue.
