# Code Editor Overview

The PHP editor integration extends and adds features to the `php` documents. It targets PHP development in general, with respect to well-known PHP frameworks and large projects.

The editor has the following features:

- [code completion](completion.md)
- code folding
- code validation
- [signature help](signature.md)
- [tooltip help](tooltips.md)
- [symbol renaming](refactoring.md)
- [symbol navigation](navigation.md)
- breadcrumbs
- code outline
- [code formatting](formatting.md)
- [mixed html/js/css/php syntax](html-js-css.md)
- dimming unused and unrechable code
- light bulbs with code actions

Note: some editor features may work properly only after the project has been fully loaded.
