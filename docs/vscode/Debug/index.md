# Debug Overview

![PHP Xdebug with VSCode Overview](img/vscode-xdebug.png)

Debugging of PHP code in VS Code allows for inspecting a PHP program, inspecting actual variables, stack traces, exceptions, breaking and stepping through the code, debugging PHPUnit tests, and more.

## Requirements

In order to debug a PHP program, you need PHP (either installed locally or on your server) together with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org) extension.

- PHP >= 5.6
- Xdebug extension. Follow the steps on [Xdebug.org Install](https://xdebug.org/docs/install).

### Local PHP Installation

In case there are more PHP installations on the system, see [choosing PHP Version](../php-version.md) and select the right one.

To verify your PHP and Xdebug are installed correctly:

- Open a `.php` file in VS Code
- Open the `OUTPUT` view, tab `PHP`.

![PHP info](img/output-php-xdebug.png)

If PHP with Xdebug is installed correctly, you will see

```
Found PHP, version x.y.z, Xdebug: x.y.z.
```

### `php.ini` Configuration

Xdebug needs to be set in `php.ini` file that corresponds to your PHP installation.

- **On Windows** it is located next to your `php.exe`.
- On **Linux/Mac**, there is usually a separate `xdebug.ini` file (usually something like `/etc/php/8.0/cli/xdebug.ini`).

Edit the `.ini` file, and ensure there are the following directives (Note, the directives are different for Xdebug versions `2` and `3`):

```ini
; Xdebug 3
zend_extension = "<path to the xdebug library>" ; "...\xdebug.dll" or ".../xdebug.so"
xdebug.mode = debug
xdebug.client_host = 127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port = 9003
xdebug.start_with_request = trigger
```

```ini
; Xdebug 2
zend_extension = "<path to the xdebug library>" ; "...\xdebug.dll" or ".../xdebug.so"
xdebug.remote_enable = 1
xdebug.remote_handler = dbgp
xdebug.remote_host = 127.0.0.1
xdebug.remote_port = 9000
xdebug.remote_mode = req
```

### Server PHP Installation

> This applies to the situation when PHP is not running on your local system but it's on a **Cloud**, **Web Host**, **Docker**, **Xampp**, etc.

In case `php` itself is not running on your local system, consult the installation of PHP+Xdebug with the specific server host.

You can then take advantage of [DBGP Proxy](dbgp-proxy.md) to allow multiple users to debug the same site safely.

## Launching Debug in VSCode

Launch debugging in Visual Studio Code to either run the program and debug, or to listen for incoming Xdebug connections and debug. PHP debugging can be initiated in several ways, with or without VS Code Workspace, with or without the configured `launch.json`.

### With `launch.json`

> The file `.vscode/launch.json` is a configuration file within your VS Code Folder or Workspace.

1. **Open Folder** or **Open Workspace** in VS Code. This allows for specifying more detailed debug launch configurations.
2. Navigate to `Run and Debug` view, and click `create a launch.json` or the configuration gear:
    ![VSCode debug configurations gear](img/config.png)
3. See [launch.json](launch-json.md) for the initialization and description of the PHP launch profiles.

### No `launch.json`, Just Debug

Debugging can be started without any configuration. This is recommended if you just need to attach to an existing Web Server (with Xdebug configured) or to quickly run and debug a PHP script.

1. **Open a .`php` file** in VS Code (`File / Open File`).
2. Press **`F5`** or Open Command Palette (`F1`) and choose one of the following:
    ![Debug Quick Pick](img/debug-config-pick.png)

- `Listen for Xdebug` starts debugging and waits for an incoming Xdebug connection.
- `Launch current script in console` runs and debugs the currently opened PHP document as a console PHP program.
- `Launch built-in server` starts PHP development server within your opened folder, checks for the debugging capabilities, and starts listening for the Xdebug connections.

## Features

The debugging features are the following:

- Stepping by line, step in, step out.
- Placing breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, break on hit count.
- Logging breakpoint hit into 'Debug console'.
- Breaking on exceptions, warnings, and errors.
- Specifying non-user files (exceptions won't break debugging, stepping through).
- Watch tool tips.
- Listing locals and superglobals.
- Editing variable or property value, handling long string values efficiently.
- Long arrays watch efficiently.
- Debug watch expands objects and arrays.
- Evaluating code in 'Debug console'.
- Debug launch profiles.
- Built-in web development server.
- Debugging of 'PHP Unit' test cases.

### Debug Adornments

When stepping through the code, the editor will display values of variables and expressions corresponding to the current statement. Values are also shown for the enclosing scopes such as loop control variables, switch expression, and function parameters.

This feature can be enabled or disabled using VS Code Setting `"debug.inlineValues"`.

### Start Debug and Stop on Entry

Open **command palette** and run `Start Debugging and Stop on Entry` (aka *Step Into*). The command launches debugging and breaks on the first statement. 

## Troubleshooting

These are steps that should help to diagnose and solve common problems with debugging PHP:

- Running the following command should display **no warnings**, and an **Xdebug notice**:
  ```bash
  php --version
  ```
  ```
  PHP 8.0.3 (cli) Copyright (c) The PHP Group
  Zend Engine v4.0.3, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
      with Xdebug v3.0.4, Copyright (c) 2002-2021, by Derick Rethans
  ```

- The port number specified in Xdebug `.ini` configuration should be `9000` or `9003`, or it should match the `"port"` specified in the [Launch Profiles](launch-json.md).
- Firewall must be properly set up to allow communication through the Xdebug port.
- Append the following query parameter when opening the debugged PHP Web Site:
  ```
  ?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1
  ```
  For example: `http://localhost/?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1`
- In case the VS Code is behind a proxy, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/network for additional settings.
