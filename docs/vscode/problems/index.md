# Problems and Code Validation

The editor analyzes user's code, builds index of everything in the workspace, infers variables type, and performs vast array of [diagnostics](https://docs.devsense.com/vs/code%20validation/diagnostics). Analysis is performed incrementally and continuously on background, i.e. only changed pieces of code are parsed and analysed and list of problems updated accordingly.
