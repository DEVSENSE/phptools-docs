# Code Actions

The editor provides so-called **Code Actions**. Code actions are available for quick refactorings and quick fixes of code problems. The available code action is annotated with a light bulb next to the text.

Available code actions are listed by clicking on the light bulb or pressing an associated keyboard shortcut (by default) <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+.</kbd>.

Certain code problems have also `Quick Fix` available. This provides code actions that should resolve the problem. Quick fixes are also available right in _Problems_ window, next to each problem listed.
