# Composer

## Installation

Composer _All-in-One_ is a part of **PHP Tools** extension. Although it can be installed separatelly from the [Composer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.composer-php-vscode) extension page.

## Composer.json Editor &amp; IntelliSense

The `composer.json` editor is extended with smart actions, code lenses, tooltips, and IntelliSense to autocomplete packages and versions from _packagist.org_.

### Completion of Package Names

Code completion searches packages and lists their names with detailed information including downloads, favorites, abandoned information, and description. There are also quick links to the package _home page_, package _source_ code, and _packagist page_.

### Completion of Package Versions

Available minor versions are fetched from packagist listed in code completion after the required package name:

### Tool-Tips

Installed package details are displayed in the tooltips.

### Code Actions

Quickly `update` or `remove` package right from the editor, using the code actions:

### Installed Version Inlay

Actual installed version is displayed connveniently next to the package required version:

### Run-Script CodeLens

The `"scripts"` section of `composer.json` gets a small code-lens allowing to quickly run the corresponding script, right from the editor:

### Diagnostics &amp; Abandoned Packages

The extension watches for installed packages and checks if any of them isn't abandoned. Abandoned packages are listed in VS Code's **problems** view, strikethrough, and the tooltip shows the corresponding abandoned message:

## Commands

Integrated commands work with the `composer.json` in the workspace root directory. If necessary, commands ask which workspace folder you're referring to. It allows quickly `require`, `remove`, or *search* for packages from packagist.org, and more.

The following commands are usually executed as a VSCode task, using `php` executable as configured in the `Settings`, and `composer.phar` downloaded automatically when necessary (so it is not necessary to install it by yourself).
    
### `composer: install`

Runs the `install` command.

### `composer: update`

Runs the `update` command.

### `composer: require`

The `composer: require` command shows quick-pick with online search, and installs the selected package. The search displayed all the important information including packages description, downloads, and favorites.

### `composer: require-dev`

Requires a **dev** package; this works the same as `composer: require` but the packageis installed as a development dependency.

### `composer: remove`

Removes installed package or more packages from the project. The command shows quick pick with multi-selection allowing to choose the packages to be removed:

![composer remove](imgs/composer-remove.gif)

### `composer: create-project ...`

Open an empty folder in VS Code, and create a new project from a composer package. The command shows quick-pick that searches online for available packages and invokes the `create-project` command for you:

![composer create-project](imgs/composer-create-project.gif)

### `composer: search ...`

Search packages on _packagist.org_. Quickly browse through packages, read descriptions, open details on packagist.org or `require` the package right from the quick pick menu.

### `composer: run-script ...`

Quickly run your composer script from command palette:

![composer run-script](imgs/composer-run-script.gif)

### `composer: check-platform-reqs`
    
### `composer: update the internal composer.phar`

The extension automatically downloads the latest composer installation, and uses it for all the tasks and commands. Run `composer: update the internal composer` to manually re-download the latest snapshot.

### `composer: about`

Shows the about information.

### `composer: archive ...`

Runs the `archive` command, and asks for arguments.

### `composer: clear-cache`

Clear the internal composer cache.

### `composer: fund`

Shows your required packages funding options.

### `composer: licenses`

Shows summary of your required packages licenses.

### `composer: outdated`

Shows list of outdated packages.

### `composer: reinstall`

Runs the `reinstall` command.

## Tasks

VS Code task that executes a `composer` command is a useful way of configuring and running composer. The `composer.phar` itself is automatically installed, and `php` executable is determined from `Settings`.

_Example:_

```json
"tasks": [
    {
        "label": "check",
        "type": "composer",
        "command": "check-platform-reqs",
        "args": []
    }
]
```

## Schema Validation

The extension provides schema validation for `composer.json` files, maintained by [@composer](https://github.com/composer/composer).

- correctness validation.
- tooltips and code completion for `composer.json` JSON elements.

## Configuration

If there's an existing installation of `composer.phar` under the following paths, it's used as it is:

- `/usr/bin/composer` (Linux/OsX)
- `/usr/local/bin/composer` (Linux/OsX)
- `${COMPOSER_HOME}/composer.phar`
- `.composer/composer.phar` under user's home (Linux, OsX)
- `${APP_DATA}/Composer/composer.phar` (Windows)

Otherwise, the extension automatically downloads `composer.phar` latest snapshot, uses it, and keeps it updated. The location respects the Composer default installation path which can be changed by setting the `COMPOSER_HOME` environment variable.

### Additional Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `php.executablePath` | The value is used to determine `php` executable path for running composer commands. If not set, `"php"` is used by default.<br/><br/>In case, there is [PHP Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode) extension installed, composer commands are executed using `php` set with [PHP Version Picker](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/php-version). |
