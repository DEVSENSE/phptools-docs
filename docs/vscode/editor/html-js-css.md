# HTML/CSS/JS Support

PHP Tools does not change the behavior of standalone HTML, JS or CSS files at all. The extension influences only the PHP source files. HTML, JS and CSS in PHP source files support the same features as they do without PHP. The support is provided by Visual Studio Code and PHP Tools only integrates the functionality in PHP source files. The supported features include the following:

- IntelliSense
- Close tags
- Color picker
- Hover
- Validation
- Folding
- Formatting
- Emmet snippets
