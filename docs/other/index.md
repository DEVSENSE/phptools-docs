# Other IDEs

PHP Tools are available for a wide range of development environments. In addition to dedicated integrations, we also provide a standalone Language Server package for building custom editor support.

## VS Code Compatible Editors

For **Cursor**, **VSCodium**, and similar editors. (see [docs](../vscode/))

Most forks of Visual Studio Code are compatible with the [PHP Tools for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode).

The extension release is available on [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/extension/devsense/phptools-vscode), the open-source registry for VS Code-compatible editors.

## Zed IDE

See [Zed IDE Support](./zed.md) for details.

## Language Server Protocol (LSP)

Many editors support direct integration with language servers, often with minimal configuration.

The PHP Tools Language Server is available as a standalone [NodeJS package `devsense-php-ls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devsense-php-ls). Visit the [devsense-php-ls](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devsense-php-ls) for installation instructions and usage details.
