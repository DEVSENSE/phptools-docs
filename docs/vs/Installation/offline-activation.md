## Offline Activation

In case there is no Internet connection available or the Internet is blocked by company policies, PHP Tools activation can be processed in a web browser on another machine with a working Internet connection.

To access offline activation, proceed to the normal product activation by entering your license key, as shown in the picture above. The activation dialog will popup a message saying it cannot reach the server and will **provide an alternate URL** that can be copied and opened in a web browser with working connection (see picture below).

After opening the URL in the web browser, the page generates an offline key (*a long-base64-encoded text*) which can be copied and pasted back to the activation dialog, instead of the regular license key.

> Note: the offline key only works for the machine which gave you the alternate URL.
