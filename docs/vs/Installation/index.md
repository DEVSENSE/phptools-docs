## Basic Installation

You will need to have *Microsoft Visual Studio* installed before installing PHP Tools. You can download the free Community version [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or use any other Visual Studio version, except for Express versions, which are not supported.

If you already have Microsoft Visual Studio installed, you can jump directly to the **Manage Extensions** dialog and search for **PHP Tools for Visual Studio**.

Once downloaded, you'll be prompted to close Visual Studio. The package will be installed and Visual Studio configured for the PHP development. After starting Visual Studio next time, you can proceed to the [product activation](activation.md) and [get started](../index.md).

If you would like more detailed steps, please, continue reading.

## Prerequisites

To install PHP Tools for Visual Studio, you'll need:

- **Administrator access**. Please ensure you can provide administrator access to your hard drive because the installation package copies files to the system's _AppData_. For Visual Studio 2010 up to 2015, you'll be queried to allow access to the system's _Program Files_*.

- **Microsoft Visual Studio**. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). You can choose the **Community** edition, which is the **free**** option, or any other Visual StudioÂ´s supported editions, such as *Professional*, *Enterprise* or higher. Express editions are not supported.

## Download and Installation

 PHP Tools installation package can be downloaded from:

## Troubleshooting

### PHP Tools cannot be found on VS Marketplace

### VSIXInstaller.NoApplicableSKUsException: This extension is not installable on any currently installed products.

If you see this message in the VSIX Installer log, it usually means you will need to update your Visual Studio.
