## Manage Users

Under the **Subscriptions** page, each subscription lets you to **Manage Users**. Here users can be disabled to increase the available seats number, or to **extend seats** by purchasing additional seats for more users.

- **Active** state signalizes a user that activated the license on his machine.
- **Inactive** state signalizes a user that has been disabled, or a user that could not activate the product due to insufficient seats count.
- **Disable** button frees the taken seat, and deactivates the user.
- **Block** disallows user to activate the product.

## Purchase more seats

The **Manage Users** page above allows to quickly increase the subscription seats count. Whenever there are more active users than the license was purchased for, the number can be increased at this page.

The number represents **the total number** of seats after the purchase. Extending the number of seats also renews the subscription. The price is calculated as new seats price after the quantity discount, plus the renewal price accordingly to the expiration date.
