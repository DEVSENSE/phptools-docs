# Test Explorer

The Test Explorer is a Visual Studio tool window containing a list of test cases organized by projects, groups or by test suites. To open the window, go to `Test | Windows | Test Explorer`. The Test Explorer allows to run and debug all tests, selected tests or tests listed in a group or suite.

The window lists all the available test suites by looking at `phpunit.xml` and `phpunit.xml.dist` configuration files within all the opened projects.
