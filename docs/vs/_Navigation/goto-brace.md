# Go To Brace

Having the keyboard cursor at a left or a right brace (including parenthesis `()`, brackets `[]` or braces `{}`) within PHP code is handled by PHP Editor in various ways.

## Highlighting

If the cursor is at the outer side of the brace, the brace and its matching brace are highlighted.

## Go To Brace

If the cursor is at the outer or inner side of the brace, by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+]</kbd> cursor is navigated to its matching brace. If there are two braces around the cursor, the closest one is used for the match.

Pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+]</kbd> encloses brace match in a text selection.
