# New Project from Existing Code

If there is already a folder with existing PHP code files, a new Visual Studio project can be created right from there.

## Project From Existing Code "Project Template"

In `File` / `New` / `Project`, choose the `PHP Project from Existing code` project template. The wizard will guide you through the process of creating the project in the specified location.

Click **Finish**, Visual Studio will create a new project (`.phpproj`) in the folder you specified, containing all the files within this folder.

In case your folder contains `composer.json` file and you are missing the required packages defined in the file, the following dialog will appear, asking for your permission to download the package into your project.
