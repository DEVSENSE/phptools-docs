# Syntax Highlighting

The Syntax highlighting feature makes PHP code more readable as any other language file integrated in Visual Studio. Script code blocks, variables, keywords, strings, script tags and comments are distinguished to make programming easier.

Moreover, when PHP Editor finds a syntax error or a logical error, the corresponding expression is underlined with a red wave and the error detail is listed in the Visual Studio Error List tool window.

## Settings

PHP Editor respects standard Visual Studio colors, and defines additional PHP colors. The colors are themed, and thus work well on the both Dark and Light themes.

### Short Open Tags

```php
<? // <-- short open tag, usually not enabled

?>
```

The editor respects the `short_open_tag` directive in the corresponding `php.ini` file. By default, it enables them for PHP &lt; 7.0. Otherwise, the short open tags are treated as XML tag and their content is not colorized as PHP code.

To override the default behavior and enable the short open tags, edit the Visual Studio project file (`.phpproj` file), and add the following XML fragment:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <LanguageFeatures>ShortOpenTags</LanguageFeatures>    
</PropertyGroup>
```

Reload the project if necessary.

> Note, short open tags were disabled by default since PHP 7.0.

## PHPDoc Highlighting

PHPDoc content (within `/** */` comments) is also colorized. Its tags contained type names and variable names are colored according to the settings above.

## TODO Highlighting

User's to-do comments are both listed in Visual Studio's [_Task List_](task-list.md) window, and highlighted in the source code.

## Type Names and Highlighting

Type names are highlighted with the color respecting the color name `User Types - Classes`.

## Highlighting braces

Matching pairs of braces are automatically highlighted as well. Upon moving the keyboard caret at the outer position next to any brace (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `<`, `>`), it gets highlighted together with its matching brace.

You can also jump between matching braces using the keyboard shortcut (by default `Ctrl`+`]`).

In the Visual Studio 2019 and newer, matching parenthesis within PCRE are also highlighted.

## Bracket pair colorization

When dealing with nested brackets, it can be hard to figure out which brackets match and which do not. Colorizing bracket pairs with different colors makes it easier to read the code.

In Visual Studio 2022, there is an extension that adds colors to bracket pairs - [Rainbow Braces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.RainbowBraces). PHP Code is supported since version `1.0.23`. At this time available from [CI Build](https://www.vsixgallery.com/extension/RainbowBraces.1dff1bc5-a8e4-477b-9054-2b9ec6bb88d1/).

## Switching Themes

When switching to a different color theme (e.g. Dark Theme), all built-in colors are switched as well to their default, respecting the new theme. PHP colors respect the Dark and Light themes.
