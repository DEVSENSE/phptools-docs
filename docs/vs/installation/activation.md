## User Seats

Licenses are assigned to individual users and computers upon first activation. In the case a computer is no longer in use, or a user is no longer actively using the license, you can unregister them to free up their *seat* for another user. Visit the [**Dashboard**](https://www.devsense.com/account/dashboard) in the upper right corner of this web site to do so.

1. **Create a new user account** in the dashboard, or login using available social login.
2. In case there is no *License Key* listed in your Dashnoard, **Associate License Key** first.
3. Navigate to **Subscriptions** and adjust number of seats, or disable associated seats to free them for new users.
