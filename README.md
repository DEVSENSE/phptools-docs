**PHP Tools is an all-in-one extension for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, making Visual Studio the full PHP IDE.**

The tool understands your code, provides smart code completion, quick navigation, code lenses, error checking, code validation, code formatting, integrated PHP manual, built-in web server, debugging support, PHPUnit integration, composer package manager, and much more.
