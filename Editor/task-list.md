# Task List

Visual Studio provides several tool windows helping developers to keep track of their project. Task list collects information from source code, so it is available at one place all together.

Every comment in PHP project is processed. Comments containing predefined tokens like `TODO:` or PHP Doc comments containing `@todo` tags are listed in Task List under category `Comments`.

This helps developers to keep view of tasks and work in progress, helping to build a more reliable code just by noting the comment in the source code.
